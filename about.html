                <h3 class="grey">EDUCATION</h3>
                <p class="grey service-box">The educational system in Uzbekistan remains entrenched in antiquated academic models. Nationwide, instruction is focused on memorization, not on enabling students to apply what they learn. The school day is short (due to widespread double shifts), allocated time for academic subjects is very low and is compounded by an ambitious and congested curriculum that is not based on national standards. USAID’s assistance in the education sector restarted in 2019 to support the President of Uzbekistan and Ministry of Public Education’s ambitious efforts to reform and modernize the education sector and ensure that the human capital development needs of the country are met through the provision of high-quality basic education service delivery.</p> <br>
                <p class="bg-dark service-box--dark">To prevent the spread of COVID-19 among schoolchildren in Uzbekistan, Public Service Announcements (PSAs) and print materials were developed through Sesame Workshop to help families acquire new healthy habits. The media package reached 7 million people daily, and a survey conducted by the Ministry of Public Education showed that 75 percent of responders found the PSAs extremely useful.
